Maze Solver: 

We have:
- S where maze start, 
- E where maze ends,
- \# where is wall 

<img src="/static/images/algorithms/alogrihtms-maze.png" alt="Maze" className="my-6" />

At any one square we can go up, we can go right, down and left. So we need to check:
- if go off the map,
- if we run into walls
- if it's the end
- if we go to the spot were we was been before.

All these We should consider in our base case. **There is the reason why you consider the base case, and you don't check for it in the recursive case.**

Recursive cases is simply checking every direction. So recursion is just "go all four directions" and the base case is just "can't be any of these places".

```ts
const dir = [
  [-1, 0],
  [1, 0],
  [0, -1],
  [0, 1]
]
function walk(maze: string[], wall: string, curr: Point, end: Point, seen: boolean[][], path: Point[]):boolean {
  // 1. Base Case
  // off the map
  if(curr.x < 0 || curr.x >= maze[0].length || curr.y < 0 || curr.y >= maze.length){
    return false;
  }

  // on a wall
  if(maze[curr.y][curr.x] === wall) {
    return false;
  }

  // on end 
  if(curr.x === end.x && curr.y === end.y){
    path.push(end);
    return true;
  }

  // already been there
  if(seen[curr.y][curr.x]){
    return false;
  }

  // 3 recurse
  // pre
  seen[curr.y][curr.x] = true;
  path.push(curr);

  // recurse
  for(let i = 0; i < dir.length; ++i){
    const [x,y] = dir[i];
    if(walk(maze,wall,{x: curr.x + x, y: curr.y + y}, end, seen, path)){ 
      return true
    }
  }
  // post - if he can't go forward, remove current point
  path.pop()
  // Tell point behind that current point is dead end
  return false;
}

export default function solve(maze: string[], wall: string, start: Point, end: Point): Point[]{
  const seen: boolean[][] = [];
  const path: Point[] = [];

  for(let i = 0; i < maze.length; ++i){
    seen.push(new Array(maze[0].length).fill(false))
  }

  walk(maze, wall, start, end, seen, path);

  return path;
}
```

<Callout>Move everything you can into the base case, your complexity will go massively down, and it's a lot easier to solve.</Callout>

When do i use recursion?

Use it when its not able to be done via for loop.

It's O(4N) so it is **O(N)**
