React is JavaScript library that lets you build user interface out of individual pieces.

---

**The major features of React are:**

1. Uses **JSX** syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allow developers to write HTML in their JS code.
2. It uses **Virtual DOM** instead of Real DOM.
3. Supports **server-side rendering** whitch is useful for SEO.
4. Follows **one-way** data flow or data binding.
5. Uses **reusable** UI components to develop the view.

---

**JSX**

JSX stands for JavaScript XML, it allow to write HTML in JS code. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the React.createElement function.

---

**virtual DOM**

---

**pure components**

Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components,
you can achieve pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous
props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.

---

**props**

Props are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components.
The primary purpose of props in React is to pass custom data to your component and to trigger state changes.

---

**difference between state and props**

- **state** is managed by the component itself and can be updated using setState() function. State can be modified by the component and is used to manage the internal state of the component.
- **props** are passed to a component by its parent component and are read-only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the component itself.

---

**synthetic events**

**SyntheticEvent** is cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event.
Its API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`,
except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using `nativeEvent` atribute.

```tsx
function BookStore{
  handleTitleChange(e) {
    console.log('The new title is:', e.target.value);
    // 'e' represents synthetic event
    const nativeEvent = e.nativeEvent;
    console.log(nativeEvent);
    e.stopPropogation();
    e.preventDefault();
  }

  return <input name="title" onChange={handleTitleChange} />
}

```
---

**inline conditional expressions**

```tsx
<>
  {messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (
    <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
  ) : (
    <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>
  )}
</>
```

**key prop**

## Typescript

### ReactNode vs Element type

React.ReactNode -> can accept: -> `<div />`, "Hello!", 123, undefined

JSX.Element -> can accept only: -> `<div />`


### It will call function when variable is dispose.

```ts
const mockSomething = () => {
  // Mock the thing in here!
  const myMock = "something";

  return {
    [Symbol.dispose]: () => {
      // Dispose of the mock in here!
    },
    value: myMock,
  }
}

it("Should log to the console", () => {
  using mock = mockSomething();

  console.log(mock.value);
  // It gets automatically disposed each time!
});

```

### Typescript tip:

```ts
type TODO = any;
```

### const Type

```ts
declare function useStatuses<T>(statuses: T[]): T;

// ...it gets inferred as just string
const loadingStatus = useStatuses(["loading", "idle"]);
//const loadingStatus: string
```

```ts
declare function useStatuses2<const T>(statuses: T[]): T;

const loadingStatus2 = useStatuses2(["loading","idle"]);
// const loadingStatus2: "loading" | "idle"
```

### get Type

```ts
const roles = ["user", "admin", "superadmin"] as const;

type Role = (typeof roles)[number];
// "user" | "admin" | "superadmin"
```

### 

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  const audioRef = useRef<ElementRef<"audio">>(null);

  return <audio ref={audioRef}>Hello</audio>;
};
```
