## watch()

Watches one or more reactive data sources and invokes a callback function when the sources change.

watch() is lazy by default - i.e. the callback is only called when the watched source has changed.

### Parameters 

**First argument**

- A getter function that returns a value
- A ref
- A reactive object
- ...or an array of the above.

**Second argument**

Callback that will be called when the source changes.

The callback receives three arguments: the new value, the old value, and a function for registering a side effect cleanup callback. 

The cleanup callback will be called right before the next time the effect is re-run, and can be used to clean up invalidated side effects, e.g. a pending async request.

**Third optional argument**

- `immediate` trigger the callback immediately on watcher creation. Old value will be undefined on the first call.
- `deep` force deep traversal of the source if it is an object, so that the callback fires on deep mutations.
- `flush` adjust the callback's flush timing
- `onTrack / onTrigger` debug the watcher's dependencies.

```ts
interface WatchOptions extends WatchEffectOptions {
  immediate?: boolean // default: false
  deep?: boolean // default: false
  flush?: 'pre' | 'post' | 'sync' // default: 'pre'
  onTrack?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
  onTrigger?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
}
```



### Example: Stopping the watcher

```javascript
const stop = watch(source, callback)

// when the watcher is no longer needed:
stop()
```

## watchEffect()

Runs a function immediately while reactively tracking its dependencies and re-runs it whenever the dependencies are changed.

### Parameters 

**First argument**

The effect function receives a function that can be used to register a cleanup callback. The cleanup callback will be called right before the next time the effect is re-run, and can be used to clean up invalidated side effects, e.g. a pending async request.

**Second optional argument**

Object that can be used to adjust the effect's flush timing or to debug the effect's dependencies.

- Setting flush: 'post' will defer the watcher until after component rendering.

- In rare cases, it might be necessary to trigger a watcher immediately when a reactive dependency changes, e.g. to invalidate a cache. This can be achieved using flush: 'sync'. However, this setting should be used with caution, as it can lead to problems with performance and data consistency if multiple properties are being updated at the same time.

### Example: simple

```javascript
const count = ref(0)

watchEffect(() => console.log(count.value))
// -> logs 0

count.value++
// -> logs 1
```

### Example

```javascript
watchEffect(async (onCleanup) => {
  const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(id.value)
  // `cancel` will be called if `id` changes
  // so that previous pending request will be cancelled
  // if not yet completed
  onCleanup(cancel)
  data.value = await response
})
```
