1. FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring files between a client and a server. It can operate in two modes: active and passive.

2. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol): A secure version of FTP that uses SSH to encrypt the connection, providing secure file transfer capabilities.

3. FTPS (FTP Secure): An extension of FTP that adds support for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocols.

4. WebSocket: A protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data transfer between clients and servers.

5. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport): A lightweight messaging protocol optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks, often used in IoT applications.

6. CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol): Designed for use in simple devices and low-power networks, CoAP is often used in IoT scenarios.

7. gRPC: A high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport and allows for efficient communication between services.

8. AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol): A protocol for message-oriented middleware, enabling different systems to communicate with each other.

9. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3: These are newer versions of HTTP that improve performance and efficiency, with HTTP/3 using QUIC as its transport layer.

10. POP (Post Office Protocol)

11. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) both deal with email.
