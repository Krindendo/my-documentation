JS is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard, which is guided by the TC39 committee and hosted by ECMA. It runs in browsers and other JS environments such as Node.js.

**Hige level:**


**Single threaded:**


**Garbage collection:**


**Interpreted:**


**JIT compiled:**

JS is a compiled language, meaning the tools (including the JS engine) process and verify a program (reporting any errors!) before it executes.

**Prototype based:**


**Multi-paradigm:**

JS is a multi-paradigm language, meaning the syntax and capabilities allow a developer to mix and match (and bend and reshape!) concepts from various major paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented (OO/classes), and functional (FP).

**Dynamic language:**


**Non-blocking event loop:**
