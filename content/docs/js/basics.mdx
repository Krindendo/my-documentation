### Difference between var, let and const

Scope: var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped.

Hoisting: var is hoisted and initialized with undefined, while let and const are hoisted but not initialized (so accessing them before declaration results in an error).
[more about this](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/ch5.md#uninitialized-variables-aka-tdz)

Reassignment: var and let allow reassignment, but const does not.

### Difference between null and undefined

Both null and undefined represent the absence of a value.

`undefined` - indicates a variable has been declared but no value has been assigned.

- Declaring a variable without initialization (e.g., let x;).
- A function doesn't return a value explicitly (returns undefined by default).
- Accessing a non-existent property on an object.

`null` - Represents an intentional absence of value. It's a way to say "this variable should hold no value."

Despite the difference, null == undefined evaluates to true due to JavaScript's type coercion rules (check for equality without strict type checking). However, null === undefined is false (strict comparison checks both type and value).

### Array methods:

**every**

- tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function

```javascript
array1.every((currentValue) => currentValue < 40);
```

**some**

- tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function

```javascript
array1.some((element) => element % 2 === 0);
```

**reduce**

- It allows you to iterate over each element in the array and accumulate them into a single value. It takes two arguments:

1. Reducer Function: This is a custom function you define that specifies how each element should be processed and accumulated.

   - Accumulator: This holds the accumulated value from previous iterations (initially the first element or a provided starting value).

   - Current Element: This is the element from the array being processed in the current iteration.

2. (Optional) Initial Value: This is an optional first argument that sets the starting value for the accumulator. If not provided, the first element of the array becomes the accumulator in the first iteration.

Example:

- Summing an array of numbers.
- Finding the maximum or minimum value in an array.
- Creating a new object from an array.
- Filtering and transforming elements in an array.

---

```javascript title="Summing an array of numbers"
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce(function (accumulator, currentValue) {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // Outputs: 15
```

```javascript title="Summing an array of numbers"
const pets = ["Dog", "Cat", "Fish"];

const petObject = pets.reduce(function (obj, pet) {
  obj[pet] = pet;
  return obj;
}, {});

console.log(petObject);
// Outputs: { 'Dog': 'Dog', 'Cat': 'Cat', 'Fish': 'Fish' }
```

```javascript title="Filtering and transforming elements in an array"
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Filter out odd numbers and square the even numbers
let result = numbers.reduce(function (accumulator, currentValue) {
  if (currentValue % 2 === 0) {
    accumulator.push(currentValue * currentValue);
  }
  return accumulator;
}, []);

console.log(result);
// Outputs: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

**shift**

- removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const firstElement = array1.shift();
console.log(array1);
// Expected output: Array [2, 3]
```

**unshift**

- adds the specified elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(array1.unshift(4, 5));
// Expected output: 5

console.log(array1);
// Expected output: Array [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

**pop**

- removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

```javascript
const plants = ["cabbage", "kale", "tomato"];

console.log(plants.pop());
// Expected output: "tomato"

console.log(plants);
// Expected output: Array ["cabbage", "kale"]
```

**push**

- adds the specified elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

```javascript
const animals = ["pigs", "goats", "sheep"];

const count = animals.push("cows");
console.log(count);
// Expected output: 4
console.log(animals);
// Expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows"]
```

**slice**

- returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array.

```javascript
const animals = ["ant", "bison", "camel", "duck", "elephant"];

console.log(animals.slice(2));
// Expected output: Array ["camel", "duck", "elephant"]

console.log(animals.slice(2, 4));
// Expected output: Array ["camel", "duck"]
```

**splice**

- changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

```javascript
const months = ["Jan", "March", "April", "June"];
months.splice(1, 0, "Feb");
// Inserts at index 1
console.log(months);
// Expected output: Array ["Jan", "Feb", "March", "April", "June"]

months.splice(4, 1, "May");
// Replaces 1 element at index 4
console.log(months);
// Expected output: Array ["Jan", "Feb", "March", "April", "May"]
```

---

**flat**

- creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.

```javascript
const arr1 = [0, 1, 2, [3, 4]];

console.log(arr1.flat());
// expected output: Array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**flatMap**

- returns a new array formed by applying a given callback function to each element of the array, and then flattening the result by one level. It is identical to a map() followed by a flat() of depth 1 (arr.map(...args).flat()), but slightly more efficient than calling those two methods separately.

```javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 1];

const result = arr1.flatMap((num) => (num === 2 ? [2, 2] : 1));

console.log(result);
// Expected output: Array [1, 2, 2, 1]
```

**map**

- creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];
console.log(array1.map((x) => x * 2));
// Expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]
```

### Map (week Map)

- Maps are collections of **key-value pairs**, similar to objects. However, unlike objects, Maps allow any data type to be used as a key, including strings, numbers, objects, or even other Maps. **Maps remembers the original insertion order of the keys.**

`set(key, value)`: Adds a new key-value pair to the Map.

`get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with a specific key.

`has(key)`: Checks if a particular key exists in the Map.

`delete(key)`: Removes a key-value pair from the Map.

`size`: Returns the number of key-value pairs in the Map.

`clear()`: Removes all key-value pairs from the Map.

#### Map vs Weak Map

There are no ways to enumerate a `Weak Map` or to get all it's values. In `Weak Map`, you can store the data based on a key and when the key gets garbage collected so do the values.

- Keys must be objects or functions.

- Object presence as a key in a `Weak Map` does not prevent from being garbage collected.

```ts
var k1 = { a: 1 };
var k2 = { b: 2 };

var map = new Map();
var weakMap = new WeakMap();

map.set(k1, "k1");
weakMap.set(k2, "k2");

k1 = k2 = null;

console.log(map.get(k1)); // {a: 1}
console.log(weakMap.get(k2)); // undefined
```

#### Map vs objects

**Map:**

1. Map can have keys of any data type, including objects, functions, and primitive values.
2. Map keys are ordered based on their insertion order.
3. Maps have built-in methods for iteration, such as forEach, keys, values, and entries.

**Objects:**

1. Object keys are always strings or symbols. If other data types are used as keys, they are automatically converted to strings.
2. Object properties do not have a guaranteed order.
3. Objects have a prototype chain and inherit properties and methods from their prototype objects.

### Set (weak Set)

The **Set** objects are collections of values. A value in the set **may occur once**. It can store any type of values.

Example:

- When you need to store a collection of unique values and the order of insertion matters.

- When you want to use objects, arrays as keys.

- When you want to maintain strong references to the values in collection

#### Set vs Weak Set

The **Weak Set** can only store objects and does not prevent those objects from being garbage collected when they are no longer in use.

Examples:

- You want to store a collection of objects and don't want to prevent them from being garbage collected.

- You need to associate metadata or additional information with objects.

- You want to create relationships between objects without preventing them from being released when they are no longer needed.

### How to iterate through object

1. for...in loop:

```javascript
for (const key in person) {
  console.log(key, person[key]);
}
```

2. Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries()

- `Object.keys(object)`: Returns an array of all enumerable string property names of the object.
- `Object.values(object)`: Returns an array of all enumerable property values of the object.
- `Object.entries(object)`: Returns an array of key-value pairs as sub-arrays.

### How to define functions, how to have dynamic arguments?

1. Function Declaration

```javascript
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
  // Function body containing statements to be executed
  return value; // Optional return statement
}
```

2. Function Expression

```javascript
const functionName = function (parameter1, parameter2) {
  // Function body
  return value;
};
```

JavaScript provides the rest parameter syntax to capture an indefinite number of arguments passed to a function

```javascript
function functionName(...parameter) {
  return parameter;
}
```

### Promise

A **Promise** is an object returned by an asynchronous function, which represents the current state of the operation. It has two properties: `state` and `result`.

**Promise** is can be one of these `states`:

- **Prending** -> initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.

- **Fullfilled** -> meaning that the operation was completed succesful.

- **Rejected** -> meaning that the operation failed.

Deeper explanation:

```javascript
new Promise((resolve, rejected) => {}).then((result) => {
  console.log("result", result);
});
```

When new Promise constructor is executed a new Promise object is created in memory. That object have properties like: PromiseState, PromiseResult, PromiseFulfillReactions, PromiseRejectReactions, PromiseIsHandled.

We can resolve this Promise by calling resolve(). By doing that PromiseState is set to fulfilled and PromisResult is set to the value that we pass to resolve.

If we call reject(). PromiseState will be set to rejected and the PromiseResult is set to value we pass to the reject function.

When we call `resolve`, `resolve` is added to the call stack, `promis state` is set to **fulfilled**, `promis result` is set to the value that we pass to resolve and `promise reactions handler` reaceives that promise result. After that handler will be added to the microtask.

In Promise reaction handler will be set all function that were added in then method `.then((result) => {console.log("result", result)})`.

Microtask Queue is always get priority over Task Queue. Task from Microtask Queue will be transfer to the Call Stack only when Call Stack is empty.

### async / await

There's a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion.

**async** -> ensures that the function returns a promise.

**await** -> only works inside async functions.

### Callback hell

Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code.

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  animate(words[0]);
  setTimeout(() => {
    animate(words[1]);
    setTimeout(() => {
      animate(words[2]);
    }, 1000);
  }, 1000);
}, 1000);
```

### Difference between function and arrow function

- Both regular functions and arrow functions in JavaScript are used to define blocks of code that can be reused throughout your program.

1. Hoisting:

- Regular functions can be hoisted, meaning they can be used before they are defined in your code.
- Arrow functions cannot be hoisted. They must be defined before they are used.

2. `this` Binding:

### Closure

Closure give you access to an outer functions scope from inner function.

Scopes: **block scope**, **function scope**, **global scope**

### Shallow copy and deep copy

Primitive types in JavaScript include Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, String, and Symbol. When you assign a variable with a primitive data type to another variable, JavaScript stores the value directly and any changes to one variable do not affect the other.

Reference types, on the other hand, include Object, Array, and Function. When you assign a variable with a reference data type to another variable, JavaScript stores not the value itself, but a reference to that value. Any changes made through this reference will affect the original value because they both refer to the same place in memory.

The term "shallow copy" refers to a method of copying objects where a new reference to the object is created, but not all of its internal contents are fully copied. This means that simple property values of the original object are copied to the new object, while properties that are objects or arrays are not fully copied; instead, the new reference points to the same objects or arrays.

To create a shallow copy, we can use the following methods:

- Spread syntax `[…] {…}`

- Object.assign()

- Array.from()

- Object.create()

- Array.prototype.concat()

To create a deep copy, we can use:

- JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())

- structuredClone()

- Third party libraries like Lodash

### Functions geter and setter

Getter methods are used to access the properties of an object.

```javascript
const student = {
  // data property
  firstName: "Monica",

  // accessor property(getter)
  get getName() {
    return this.firstName;
  },
};

// accessing getter methods
console.log(student.getName); // Monica
```

Setter methods are used to change the values of an object

```javascript
const student = {
  firstName: "Monica",

  //accessor property(setter)
  set changeName(newName) {
    this.firstName = newName;
  },
};

console.log(student.firstName); // Monica

// change(set) object property using a setter
student.changeName = "Sarah";

console.log(student.firstName); // Sarah
```

### RegExp

The RegExp `regular expressions` object is used for matching text with a pattern.

These patterns are used with the `exec()` and `test()` methods of RegExp, and with the `match()`, `matchAll()`, `replace()`, `replaceAll()`, `search()`, and `split()` methods of String.

`exec` executes a search with this regular expression for a match in a specified string and returns a result array, or null.

`test` executes a search with this regular expression for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns true if there is a match.

```javascript
const re = /ab+c/i;
// OR
const re = new RegExp("ab+c", "i");
// OR
const re = new RegExp(/ab+c/, "i");
```

### call, apply, bind

While functions in JavaScript are powerful on their own, the **call**, **apply**, and **bind** methods further extend their capabilities. These methods are associated with functions and allow you to manipulate how a function is invoked and the context in which it executes.

**call**: The call method invokes a function with a specified this value and individual arguments passed as separate arguments. It allows you to borrow functions from one object and invoke them in the context of another.

**apply**: Similar to call, the apply method invokes a function with a specified this value, but it takes an array or an array-like object as its second argument, allowing you to pass a variable number of arguments to the function.

**bind**: The bind method creates a new function that, when called, has its this value set to a specific value and prepends any provided arguments to the original function's arguments list. It is often used to create functions with preset contexts or partially applied arguments.

```js
var user = {
  firstname: "Lorem",
  lastname: "Ipsum",
  getUserName: function () {
    var fullname = this.firstname + " " + this.lastname;
    return fullname;
  },
};

var userName = function (snack, hobby) {
  console.log(this.getUserName() + " loves " + snack + " and " + hobby);
};

userName.call(user, "sushi", "algorithms"); // Lorem Ipsum loves sushi and algorithms
userName.apply(user, ["sushi", "algorithms"]); // Lorem Ipsum loves sushi and algorithms
```

```js
var user = {
  firstname: "Lorem",
  lastname: "Ipsum",
  getUserName: function () {
    var fullname = this.firstname + " " + this.lastname;
    return fullname;
  },
};

var userName = function () {
  console.log(this.getUserName());
};

var logUserName = userName.bind(user); // creates new object and binds user. 'this' of user === user now

logUserName(); // 'Lorem Ipsum'
```

### Immutable vs mutable

An immutable value is one whose content cannot be changed without creating an entirely new value.

- Primitive values are immutable - once a primitive value is created, it cannot be changed, although the variable that holds it may be reassigned another value.

- Immutability of redux state is necessary since it allows detecting redux state changes in an efficient manner.

A mutable value is one that can be changed without creating an entirely new value.

- Objects and arrays are mutable by default - their properties and elements can be changed without creating a new object or array.
