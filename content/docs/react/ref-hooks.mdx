title: Ref Hooks
description: Description test
---

Refs let a component hold some information that isnt used for rendering.

Used for saving DOM node and timeout ID.

Ref does not re-render your component.

- `useRef` You can hold any value in it, but most often its used to hold DOM node.
- `useImperativeHandle` lets you customize the ref exposed by your component.

## useRef

```tsx
function Calculator() {
  const [sum, setSum] = useState(0)
  // ...
}
```

## useImperativeHandle
