## Compound Pattern

## Higher-Order Components (HOC)

One way of being able to reuse the same logic in multiple components, is by using the higher order component pattern.

If we want to apply a certain styling to components, requiring authorization, or adding a global state.

A Higher Order Component (HOC) is a component that receives another component. The HOC contains certain logic that we want to apply to the component that we pass as a parameter. After applying that logic, the HOC returns the element with the additional logic.

In some cases, we can replace the HOC pattern with React Hooks.

Example:

```tsx title="withAuth.tsx"
const withAuth = <P extends Record<string, unknown>>(
  Component: React.ComponentType<P>
): React.FC<P> => {
  const Auth: React.FC<P> = (props) => {
    const router = useRouter();
    const { status } = useSession({
      required: true,
      onUnauthenticated() {
        router.push('/welcome/login');
      },
    });

    if (status === 'loading') {
      return 'Loading ...';
    }

    return <Component {...props} />;
  };

  return Auth;
};

export default withAuth;
```

```tsx title="dashboard.tsx"
function DashboardPage() {
    const user = useUser();
    return (
        <div>
            Hello Admin
        </div>
    );
}

export default withAuth(Control);

```
