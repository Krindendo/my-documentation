title: Effect Hooks
description: Effect includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.

- `useEffect` connects a component to an external system.
- `useLayoutEffect` fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.
- `useInsertionEffect` fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.
