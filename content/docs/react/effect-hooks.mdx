title: Effect Hooks
description: Effect includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.

- `useEffect` connects a component to an external system.
- `useLayoutEffect` fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.
- `useInsertionEffect` fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.

## useEffect

### useEffect dependency array

The useEffect controls an array containing state variables or functions that are monitored for changes. These changes then trigger the callback function.

#### Empty array

When the page is rendered, the callback function is only called once.

#### Array with state

The callback function is triggered when the page is first rendered and whenever any of the included states gets updated.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`${name}: ${age}`)
}, [name, age])
```
