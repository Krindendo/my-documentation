When to use Global state manager?

- Best for complex state managemenet when the state is spread across multiple components and these components need to communicate or share state in a more organized way.

- Redux allows you to manage global state in a centralized store, and components can easily connect to the store to read or update state.

- It provides better control over state updates, preventing unnecessary re-renders and improving performance.

## Redux

Redux toolkit will allow you to easily set redux up and connect it to your react application.

Because we are using createSlice from Redux toolkit this will do things behind the scenes without us having to set up anthing.

3 main concepts of Redux: **Store**, **Actions** and **Reducers**

Redux is a state management library that allows accessing global state.
This means that state can be accessed by any component, regardless of where it is in the tree.

Redux terms:

- Actions: An action is a plain JavaScript object that has a type field. **You can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application.**

- Reducers: A reducer is a function that receives the current state and an action object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state: (state, action) => newState. **You can think of a reducer as an event listener which handles events based on the received action (event) type.**

- Store: The current Redux application state lives in an object called the store.

- Dispatch: The Redux store has a method called dispatch. The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object.

- Selectors: Selectors are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from a store state value. As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data

#### Store:

A store is just a state that may be defined in any way and contain any content.

Stores are typically made up of many slices, each with different responsibilities for a specific domain in the application.

#### Action:

Actions represent what you want Redux to perform with the state.

The payload is optional and can be whatever data that you wish to deliver to Redux in your action so that it can do its function.

#### Reducer:

Reducers are responsible for taking an action and then depending on the type of the action will actually and make the update in the Redux store.
Use the type of the action to know what updates to do and optionally they will use the payload to do those specific updates to the Redux store.

Reducer will never directly make an update to the Redux store. It will immutable data. It means that it will never allowe to directly mutate the state
Reducer will take the state and it will make a copy of the state, then it will make changes to that copy of the state and after that will completely replace the state as a whole
with the copy that has the changes applied.

<Callout>Redux will not work if you mutate the state.</Callout>

## Zustand

### Why Zustand?

- little boilerplate

- doesnt rely provider

- faster then context - it allows you to specificly select what state you want to subscribe to

- state merging by default

- extendable by default - you can add custom middleware to give more functionality

- little opinionated

### Diferent between context and zustand

If you have context with valueA and valueB and you want to access valueA in a component, you will be subscribed to all states in that context. This is a problem, because if you change
valueB, your component will also re-render.

With zustand store, we can have multiple values in the store, but another component will subscribe only to the value that wants to subscribe. which means that it will re-render only if valueA changes.

#### Are re-renders bad?

No, if you have complex react logic, witch shoud be in useMemo or useEffect. If value doesnt change that often or is not that complext then it not problem for react to handle.

Renders dont change the DOM - all computation are on shadow DOM and only if there are diference between shadow DOM and actually DOM, there will be commands to change the DOM.
With is very expensive part
