- [`createContext`](#createcontext) lets you define and provide context to the child components. Used with [useContext](/docs/react/context-hooks#usecontext).

- [`forwardRef`](#forwardref) lets your component expose a DOM node as a ref to the parent. Used with useRef.

- [`lazy`](#lazy) lets you defer loading a component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time.

- [`memo`](#memo) lets your component skip re-renders with same props. Used with useMemo and [useCallback](/docs/react/performance-hooks#usecallback).

- [`startTransition`](#starttransition) lets you mark a state update as non-urgent. Similar to [useTransition](/docs/react/performance-hooks#usetransition).
