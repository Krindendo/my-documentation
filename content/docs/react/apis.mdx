- [`createContext`](#createcontext) lets you define and provide context to the child components. Used with [useContext](/docs/react/context-hooks#usecontext).

- [`forwardRef`](#forwardref) lets your component expose a DOM node as a ref to the parent. Used with useRef.

- [`lazy`](#lazy) lets you defer loading a component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time.

- [`memo`](#memo) lets your component skip re-renders with same props. Used with useMemo and [useCallback](/docs/react/performance-hooks#usecallback).

- [`startTransition`](#starttransition) lets you mark a state update as non-urgent. Similar to [useTransition](/docs/react/performance-hooks#usetransition).

## createContext

## forwardRef

## lazy

## memo

[memo](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) is a wrapper that will memoize the version of that component. This memoized version of your component will usually not be re-rendered when its parent component is re-rendered as long as its props have not changed. But React may still re-render it: memoization is a performance optimization, not a guarantee.

- Component: The component that you want to memoize. The memo does not modify this component, but returns a new, memoized component instead.
