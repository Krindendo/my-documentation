title: Performance Hooks

This hooks can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.

- `useMemo` lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
- `useCallback` lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.
- `useTransition` lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.
- `useDeferredValue` lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.

## useMemo

[useMemo](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo) is used to cache a calculation between re-renders. It have two parameters:

- calculateValue: The function calculating the value that you want to cache.
- dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the calculateValue code.

During renders, useMemo will return a stored value if the dependencies haven't changed, but if they have, then
callback function, calculateValue, will be calculated again and store a new value from calculateValue.

```tsx
import { useMemo } from "react"

function TodoList({ todos, tab }) {
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab])
  // ...
}
```

## useCallback

[useCallback](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback) is used to cache a function between re-renders. It have two parameters:

- fn: The function value that you want to cache. It can take any arguments and return any values. React will return (not call!) your function
  back to you during the inital render.On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the dependencies have not changed
  since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case
  it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.
- dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the fn code.

During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.

Why you need to use useCallback?

If you pass a function to children as a prop, and if parent re-renders, then children will also re-render. To prevent that behavior, you need to use React.memo on the component, but it will not work because when parent is re-render, the function that is passed as a prop will be created again. To prevent that, you need to cache the function with useCallback.

```tsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';

export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);
```

## useTransition

[useTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) is used to update the state without blocking the UI.

useTransition returns an array with exactly two values:

1. The state that tells you whether there is a pending transition.
2. The startTransition function that lets you mark a state update as a transition.

Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.

With a transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish.

```tsx
function TabContainer() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');

  function selectTab(nextTab) {
    startTransition(() => {
      setTab(nextTab);
    });
  }
  // ...
}
```

### startTransition function

startTransition function have one parametar 

scope: A function that updates some state by calling one or more set functions. React immediately calls scope with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the scope function call as transitions. They will be non-blocking and will not display unwanted loading indicators.

- useTransition is a Hook, so it can only be called inside components or custom Hooks. If you need to start a transition somewhere else (for example, from a data library), call the standalone startTransition instead.

- You can wrap an update into a transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook value, try useDeferredValue instead.

- The function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous. React immediately executes this function, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as transitions. If you try to perform more state updates later (for example, in a timeout), they won’t be marked as transitions.

- A state update marked as a transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input update.

- Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.

- If there are multiple ongoing transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that will likely be removed in a future release.
