This hooks can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.

- `useMemo` lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
- `useCallback` lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.
- `useTransition` lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.
- `useDeferredValue` lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.
