Rendering is the process of converting the code you write into user interfaces. React and Next.js enable you to build hybrid web applications in which parts of your code can be rendered on either the server or the client.

### Rendering Environments

There are two environments where web applications can be rendered: the client and the server.

- The client refers to the browser on a user's device that sends a request to a server for your application code. It then turns the response from the server into a user interface.

- The server refers to the computer in a data center that stores your application code, receives requests from a client, and sends back an appropriate response.
