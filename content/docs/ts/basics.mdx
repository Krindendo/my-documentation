### Access modifiers

The main purpose of access modifiers is to control and restrict access to members of a class.

- Public (default) - This means it can be accessed from anywhere in your code, including outside the class itself.

- Private - are only accessible within the class itself. Private properties get created by using a hash `#` prefix and cannot be legally referenced outside of the class.

- Protected - are accessible within the class and its subclasses.


### Abstract class

- You cannot use an abstract class to directly create an object. if we think of a class as a blueprint for constructing a house for example, then an abstract class is a type of blueprint that we cannot use to directly build a house. Instead, an abstract class is a class that another class can inherit from.

```ts
abstract class Shape {
  name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
     this.name = name;
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  radius: number;
  constructor(name: string, radius:number){
     super(name);
     this.radius = radius;
  }
    
}

const myShape = new Shape('My shape'); // This will throw an Error 
const shortCircle = new Circle("Short Circle", 0.5); // This will work fine.
```

### Difference between class and interface

Class:

- **A blueprint for creating objects.** It defines the properties (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.

- You can instantiate a class using the new keyword, which creates a new object with the properties and methods defined in the class.

- Classes can have constructors to initialize properties during object creation.

- A class can inherit from another class, acquiring its properties and methods.

Interface:

- Defines the structure or shape of an object and specify the properties and methods that an object has or should have.

### Partial interface

for c# this is 

- A key reason to use partial classes is to organize code related to different functionalities of the same class across multiple files.

for typescript:

- Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to optional.

### How to integrate typescript

1. install TypeScript

2. add a tsconfig.json - It differs for different project types.

3. change a files to .ts or .tsx

### Type guard

- A type guard is a mechanism that allows you to refine the type of a variable within a specific code block. It essentially performs a check to determine the exact type of the variable at runtime.

TypeScript uses built-in JavaScript operators like typeof, instanceof, and in to determine if an object contains a property.

- instanceof is a built-in type guard that can be used to check if a value is an instance of a given constructor function or class.

```ts
  interface Accessory {
      brand: string;
    }
    class Necklace implements Accessory{
      kind: string;
      brand: string;
      constructor(brand: string, kind: string) {    
        this.brand = brand;
        this.kind = kind;
      }
    }
    class bracelet implements Accessory{
      brand: string;
      year: number;
      constructor(brand: string, year: number) {    
        this.brand = brand;
        this.year = year;
      }
    }
    const getRandomAccessory = () =>{
      return Math.random() < 0.5 ?
        new bracelet('cartier', 2021) :
        new Necklace('choker', 'TASAKI');
    }
    let Accessory = getRandomAccessory();
    if (Accessory instanceof bracelet) {
      console.log(Accessory.year);
    }
    if (Accessory instanceof Necklace) {
      console.log(Accessory.brand);    
    }
  ```

  - The typeof type guard is used to determine the type of a variable.

  ```ts
  typeof v === "boolean"
  ```

  - The `in` type guard checks if an object has a particular property

  ```ts
  "house" in { name: "test", house: { parts: "door" } }; // => true
  ```

  - The `is` operator checks if a value or variable is of a specific type. 

  ```ts
  interface Cat {
      meow(): void;
  }
  interface Dog {
      bark(): void;
  }
  function isCat(pet: Dog | Cat): pet is Cat {
      return (pet as Cat).meow !== undefined;
  }
  let pet: Dog | Cat;
  // Using the 'is' keyword
  if (isCat(pet)) {
      pet.meow();
  } else {
      pet.bark();
  }
  ```
