### Access modifiers

The main purpose of access modifiers is to control and restrict access to members of a class.

- Public (default) - This means it can be accessed from anywhere in your code, including outside the class itself.

- Private - are only accessible within the class itself. Private properties get created by using a hash `#` prefix and cannot be legally referenced outside of the class.

- Protected - are accessible within the class and its subclasses.


### Abstract class

- You cannot use an abstract class to directly create an object. if we think of a class as a blueprint for constructing a house for example, then an abstract class is a type of blueprint that we cannot use to directly build a house. Instead, an abstract class is a class that another class can inherit from.

```ts
abstract class Shape {
  name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
     this.name = name;
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  radius: number;
  constructor(name: string, radius:number){
     super(name);
     this.radius = radius;
  }
    
}

const myShape = new Shape('My shape'); // This will throw an Error 
const shortCircle = new Circle("Short Circle", 0.5); // This will work fine.
```
