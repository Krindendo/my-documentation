### Primitive Types

TypeScript has three primitive types that are frequently used: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.

**Type any**

The any type is generic type used when a variable's type is unclear or hasn't yet been defined.
The any type allows one to gradually opt-in and out of type checking during compilation, which is useful when converting existing JavaScript to TypeScript.

**Type void**

The void indicates a variable's lack of a type. It acts as the opposite type to any. It is especially useful in functions that don’t return a value.

**Type unknown**

The unknown type is the type-safe counterpart of any type. You can assign anything to the unknown, but the unknown isn’t assignable to anything but itself and any, without performing a type assertion of a control-flow-based narrowing. You cannot perform any operations on a variable of an unknown type without first asserting or narrowing it to a more specific type.

**Difference between null and undifined:**
