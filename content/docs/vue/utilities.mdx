For converting values use one of these functions:

- `unref` 
- `toRef`
- `toValue`
- `toRefs`
- `toRaw`

For checking type use one of these functions:

- `isRef`
- `isProxy`
- `isReactive`
- `isReadonly`


## isRef()

Checks if a value is a ref object.

```ts
let foo: unknown
if (isRef(foo)) {
  // foo's type is narrowed to Ref<unknown>
  foo.value
}
```

## unref()

Returns the inner value if the argument is a ref, otherwise return the argument itself. 
This is a sugar function for val = isRef(val) ? val.value : val.

```ts
function useFoo(x: number | Ref<number>) {
  const unwrapped = unref(x)
  // unwrapped is guaranteed to be number now
}
```

## toRef()

Converts a reactive object property to a ref that maintains its connection with the parent object.

toRef is here to handle the two edge cases mentioned for reactive.

toRef can convert any property of a reactive object into a ref that is linked to its original parent. The property can be one that does not exist initially, or whose value is primitive.

```javascript
const state = reactive({
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2
})
```

`toRef` is useful when you copying a property from the `reactive` object to a new variable, for example foo which contains the number 1. If you copied this to a new variable, the copy would of course be a regular, non-reactive variable having no connection to the reactive object it was copied from. If foo changed later, the copy would not, meaning the copy is not reactive.

`const foo = toRef(state, 'foo')` will be very similar to `const foo = state.foo` but with two differences:
1. `foo` is a `ref` so you need to do `foo.value`
2. `foo` is linked to its parent, so reassigning `state.foo = {bar: 2}` will get reflected in `foo.value`

## toValue()

Normalizes values / refs / getters to values. This is similar to unref(), except that it also normalizes getters. If the argument is a getter, it will be invoked and its return value will be returned.

This can be used in Composables to normalize an argument that can be either a value, a ref, or a getter.

```javascript
toValue(1) //       --> 1
toValue(ref(1)) //  --> 1
toValue(() => 1) // --> 1
```

## toRefs()

Converts a reactive object to a plain object where each property of the resulting object is a ref pointing to the corresponding property of the original object. Each individual ref is created using toRef().

toRefs is used for destructing a reactive object and convert all its properties to ref

```javascript
const state = reactive({
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2
})

const stateAsRefs = toRefs(state)
/*
Type of stateAsRefs: {
  foo: Ref<number>,
  bar: Ref<number>
}
*/

// The ref and the original property is "linked"
state.foo++
console.log(stateAsRefs.foo.value) // 2

stateAsRefs.foo.value++
console.log(state.foo) // 3
```

toRefs is useful when returning a reactive object from a composable function so that the consuming component can destructure/spread the returned object without losing reactivity:

```javascript
function useFeatureX() {
  const state = reactive({
    foo: 1,
    bar: 2
  })

  // ...logic operating on state

  // will not work, destruction removes reactivity
  return {...state}; 

  // convert to refs when returning
  return toRefs(state)
}

// can destructure without losing reactivity
const { foo, bar } = useFeatureX()
```

toRefs will only generate refs for properties that are enumerable on the source object at call time. To create a ref for a property that may not exist yet, use toRef instead.

## toRaw()

toRaw() can return the original object from proxies created by reactive(), readonly(), shallowReactive() or shallowReadonly().

This is an escape hatch that can be used to temporarily read without incurring proxy access / tracking overhead or write without triggering changes. It is not recommended to hold a persistent reference to the original object. Use with caution.

```javascript
const foo = {}
const reactiveFoo = reactive(foo)

console.log(toRaw(reactiveFoo) === foo) // true
```

## isProxy()

Checks if an object is a proxy created by reactive(), readonly(), shallowReactive() or shallowReadonly().

## isReactive()

Checks if an object is a proxy created by reactive() or shallowReactive().

## isReadonly()

The proxies created by readonly() and shallowReadonly() are both considered readonly, as is a computed() ref without a set function.
