Vue is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces.

2. **Components:** Used to create reusable custom elements

3. **Templates:** VueJS provides HTML based templates that bind the DOM with the Vue instance data

4. **Routing:** Navigation between pages is achieved through vue-router

5. **Light weight:** VueJS is light weight library compared to other frameworks.
