description: How to store information in components and refresh them?
---

For storing information in component use one of these functions:

- `ref` 
- `reactive`
- `readonly`

For storing information that are reactive only root level properties use one of these functions:

- `shallowRef`
- `shallowReactive`
- `shallowReadonly`


## ref()

Takes an inner value and returns a reactive and mutable ref object, which has a single property .value that points to the inner value.

The ref object is mutable.
- you can assign new values to .value - it is also reactive 
- any read operations to .value are tracked, and write operations will trigger associated effects.

<Callout>

**If an object is assigned as a ref's value**, the object is made deeply reactive with reactive(). 
This also means if the object contains nested refs, they will be deeply unwrapped.

</Callout>

```js
const count = ref(0)
count.value++
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

## reactive()

The reactive conversion affects all nested properties. A reactive object also deeply unwraps any properties that are refs while maintaining reactivity.

```js
const obj = reactive({ count: 0 })
obj.count++
console.log(obj.value.count) // 1
```

```js
const count = ref(1)
const obj = reactive({ count })

// ref will be unwrapped
console.log(obj.count === count.value) // true

// it will update `obj.count`
count.value++
console.log(count.value) // 2
console.log(obj.count) // 2

// it will also update `count` ref
obj.count++
console.log(obj.count) // 3
console.log(count.value) // 3
```
Note that refs are not unwrapped when accessed as array or collection elements:

```js
const books = reactive([ref('Vue 3 Guide')])
// need .value here
console.log(books[0].value)

const map = reactive(new Map([['count', ref(0)]]))
// need .value here
console.log(map.get('count').value)
```

When assigning a ref to a reactive property, that ref will also be automatically unwrapped:

```js
const count = ref(1)
const obj = reactive({})

obj.count = count

console.log(obj.count) // 1
console.log(obj.count === count.value) // true
```

## readonly()

Takes an object (reactive or plain) or a ref and returns a readonly proxy to the original.

Any nested property accessed will be readonly as well. It also has the same ref-unwrapping behavior as reactive(), except the unwrapped values will also be made readonly.

```js
const original = reactive({ count: 0 })

const copy = readonly(original)

watchEffect(() => {
  // works for reactivity tracking
  console.log(copy.count)
})

// mutating original will trigger watchers relying on the copy
original.count++

// mutating the copy will fail and result in a warning
copy.count++ // warning!
```

## shallowRef()

Shallow version of ref().

```js
const state = shallowRef({ count: 1 })

// does NOT trigger change
state.value.count = 2

// does trigger change
state.value = { count: 2 }
```

<Callout>
shallowRef() is typically used for performance optimizations of large data structures, or integration with external state management systems.
</Callout>

## shallowReactive()

Shallow version of reactive().

Unlike reactive(), there is no deep conversion: only root-level properties are reactive for a shallow reactive object. Property values are stored and exposed as-is - this also means properties with ref values will not be automatically unwrapped.

```js
const state = shallowReactive({
  foo: 1,
  nested: {
    bar: 2
  }
})

// mutating state's own properties is reactive
state.foo++

// ...but does not convert nested objects
isReactive(state.nested) // false

// NOT reactive
state.nested.bar++
```

<Callout type="warning">
Shallow data structures should only be used for root level state in a component. Avoid nesting it inside a deep reactive objects.
</Callout>

## shallowReadonly()

Shallow version of readonly().

```jsx
const state = shallowReadonly({
  foo: 1,
  nested: {
    bar: 2
  }
})

// mutating state's own properties will fail
state.foo++

// ...but works on nested objects
isReadonly(state.nested) // false

// works
state.nested.bar++
```

<Callout>
Shallow data structures should only be used for root level state in a component.
</Callout>
