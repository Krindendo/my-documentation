## ref()

Takes an inner value and returns a reactive and mutable ref object, which has a single property .value that points to the inner value.

The ref object is mutable.
- you can assign new values to .value - it is also reactive 
- any read operations to .value are tracked, and write operations will trigger associated effects.

<Callout>

**If an object is assigned as a ref's value**, the object is made deeply reactive with reactive(). 
This also means if the object contains nested refs, they will be deeply unwrapped.

</Callout>

```vue
const count = ref(0)
count.value++
console.log(count.value) // 1
```
