## 3 guiding principles regardless of what the data type is:

- Columns should be small

- Simples data type

- It should be honest - schema should reflect reality

More compact data is the faster database will be able to access it.

### Integers

| Type | Storage (bytes) | Minimum Signed | Maximum Signed | Minimum Unsigned | Maximum Unsigned |
| --- | ----: | ----: | --- | ----: | --- |
| TINYINT | 1  | -128 | 127 | 0 | 255 |
| SMALLINT | 2  | -32768 | 32767 | 0 | 65535 |
| MEDIUMINT | 3  | -8388608 | 8388607 | 0 | 16777215 |
| INT | 4  | -2147483648 | 2147483647 | 0 | 4294967295 |
| BIGINT | 8  | -2^63 | 2^63-1 | 0 | 2^64-1 |

TINYINT can have negative numbers, then it need to have range from -128 to +127, thats because with negative number it shift bits to 1:

0 1111111 - -128

0 0000000 - -1

1 0000000 - +0

1 1111111 - +127

### Decimals

- DECIMAL: a fixed-precision data type that stores **exact values**.

- FLOAT: a floating-point data type that stores **approximate values**.

- DOUBLE: a floating-point data type that stores larger and more precise values than FLOAT.

To define DECIMAL it need to be define how many digits there are and how many digits should occur after the decimal point.

For example, suppose you want to store a maximum of 10 digits, with two digits after the decimal, the syntax would be:

```sql
DECIMAL(10,2)
```

### Strings

- CHAR - fixed lenght character  example: md hash, 2 digit string, something that will always going to be same size

- VARCHAR - variable character

- TINYTEXT

- TEXT

- MEDIUMTEXT

- LONGTEXT

- BINARY

- VARBINARY

- TINYBLOB

- BLOB

- MEDIUMBLOB

- LONGBLOB

- ENUM

- SET
