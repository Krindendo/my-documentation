### EXPLAIN overview


The **EXPLAIN** statement is a powerful tool that developers can use to analyze and optimize MySQL queries. It provides valuable information on how the MySQL engine accesses the table data, and can help you identify issues with slow query performance.

When we run an **EXPLAIN** statement, MySQL provides us with an overview of how the query is going to be executed, including the type of access it uses to reach the data, the index used, and the estimated number of rows accessed. With this information, we can determine which queries need optimization to improve performance.



```sql
    EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM people;
```

This statement returns output that shows how MySQL accessed the table:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for the query being executed.

- **Select** Type: Tells us the type of select statement is being executed. This can be simple, primary, union, or a few others.

- **Table**: The name of the table being accessed.

- **Partitions**: Displays the partitions being accessed for the query (beyond the scope of this course).

- **Type**: The kind of access MySQL used to retrieve the data. This is one of the most important column values.

- **Possible Keys**: The possible indexes that MySQL could use.

- **Key**: The actual index that MySQL uses.

- **Key Length**: Displays the length of the index used by MySQL.

- **Ref**: The value being compared to the index.

- **Rows**: An estimated number of rows that MySQL needs to examine to return the result.

- **Filtered**: The estimated percentage of rows that match the query criteria.

### EXPLAIN -> TYPE

Using explain types, you can gain insight into your query performance and identify areas for improvement. If you see const or ref access methods, you likely have a well-structured database that performs well. If you see index or all access methods, it might be time to investigate ways to optimize your database structure or indexing strategy.

**Const**

The **const** access method is one of the most efficient. Const access is only used when a primary key or unique index is in place, allowing MySQL to locate the necessary row with a single operation. When you see const in the type column, it's telling you that MySQL knows there is only one match for this query, making the operation as efficient as possible.

**Ref**

The **ref** access method is slightly less efficient than const, but still an excellent choice if the right index is in place. Ref access is used when the query includes an indexed column that is being matched by an equality operator. If MySQL can locate the necessary rows based on the index, it can avoid scanning the entire table, speeding up the query considerably.

**Fulltext**

MySQL provides an option to create full-text indexes on columns intended for text-based search queries. The **fulltext** access method is used when a full-text index is in place and the query includes a full-text search. **Fulltext** access allows MySQL to search the index and return the results quickly.

**Range**

When you use **range** in the where clause, MySQL knows that it will need to look through a range of values to find the right data. MySQL will use the B-Tree index to traverse from the top of the tree down to the first value of the range. From there, MySQL consults the linked list at the bottom of the tree to find the rows with values in the desired range. It's essential to note that MySQL will examine every element in the range until a mismatch is found, so this can be slower than some of the other methods mentioned so far.

**Index**

The **index** access method indicates that MySQL is scanning the entire index to locate the necessary data. **Index** access is the slowest access method listed so far, but it is still faster than scanning the entire table. When MySQL cannot use a primary or unique index, it will use **index** access if an index is available.

**All**

The **all** access method means that MySQL is scanning the entire table to locate the necessary data. All is the slowest and least efficient access method, so it's one that you want to avoid as much as possible. MySQL may choose to scan the entire table when there is no suitable index, so this is an excellent opportunity to audit your indexing strategy.
