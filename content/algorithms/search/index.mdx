### Interview example

Question:

Given two crystal balls that will break if dropped from high enough distance, determine the exact spot in which it will break in the most optimized way?

Answear:

We want to find out which floor they break on. As a result, the array will appear like this. **Do not forget that we have 2 crystal balls.**

[f,f,f,f,f,f,t,t,t,t]

f - false, t - true

Answer is that we have to jump by a fundamentally unit. In binaries we cut the space in half, but in this case we're jumping. For this example we can jump **square root of N** until we're off the board, then we can walk square root of N

- O(square root of N + square root of N) => O( 2 square root N ) => O (square root N)

Why not half of N but we take square root of N?
Because in that situaction we will need to walk half of N witch is linear time. And so that's why it is better to jump by a different amount. So jumping by the square root of N means that we will at most walk square root of N. Or in other words, the worst possible case is square root of N amount jumps until we're off the array, go back square root of N and walk square root of N.

Why square root of N?

Its just the only way we can change this from nonlinear running, Becase if we only use a binary search, we still run into a linear problem.

```ts
export default function two_crystal_balls(breaks: boolean[]): number {
  // breaks = [f,f,f,f,f,f,t,t,t,t], f - false, t - true
  const jmpAmount = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(breaks.length));

  let i = jmpAmount;
  for (; i < breaks.length; i += jmpAmount) {
    if (breaks[i]) {
      break;
    }
  }

  i -= jmpAmount;

  for (let j = 0; j <= jmpAmount && i < breaks.length; ++j, ++i) {
    if (breaks[i]) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```
