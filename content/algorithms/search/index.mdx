### Interview example

Question:

Given two crystal balls that will break if dropped from high enough distance, determine the exact spot in which it will break in the most optimized way?

Answear:

We want to find out which floor they break on. As a result, the array will appear like this. **Do not forget that we have 2 crystal balls.**

[f,f,f,f,f,f,t,t,t,t]

f - false, t - true

Answer is that we have to jump by a fundamentally unit. In binaries we cut the space in half, but in this case we're jumping.
