- Singly linked list

- Doubly linked list

The difference between a singly-lined and a doubly-linked list is that nodes in a doubly-linked list know what the previous node is.

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">- How it works</h3>

Data is organized in such a way that you will be able to visit nodes, and it will also point to the next node.
Node is often a container item witch have value of type T and next which could contain an value of another node.

If we have node A,B,C,D in 

- singly linked list: node A will point to node B, node B will point to node C ....

- doubly linked list: node A will point to node B, but node B can point to node C and to point A.

Because in singly linked list, node doesnt have reference to previous node so after you go forward, you will lost value from previous node.

Also if you get node A to point to node C, you will lost node B, and you ...

- prepend/append 
- Insertion in the middle
- Deletion from ends
- Deletion from the middle
- Get head/tail
- Get in general

```ts
interface LinkedList<T>{
  get length(): number;
  insertAt(item: T, index: number): void;
  remove(item: T) : T | undefined;
  removeAt(index: number): T | undefined;
  append(item: T): void;
  prepend(item: T): void;
  get(index: number): T | undefined;
}
```
