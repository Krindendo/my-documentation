<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">- How it works</h3>

Array buffer is array like storage that we have array from 0 to N, but also need to imagane array inside that we will acululy use.
We will have index based head and index based tail.

\[null,null,null,null,4,12,6,null,null,null\]

head is 4 and tail is 6

If you wish to remove from the front you will only increment head and clean it up. Same if you want to add new value to the end of array, increment tail.

But what if you go off the edge?

This is why this array called ring buffer. Because tail will go to the begining of the array. To tail can go first and then can go head.

this.tail % length

if you have array size 10 and you have tail that is 12, then 12 % 10 = 2 so tail will point to index 2.

The only problem is when tail exceeds head. Then we need to resize array. Main thing in ring buffer is they also maintain order. If this happend you only need to do is start from head go the length and write that into a new larger capacity buffer.

- get(idx) - O(1)
- push(value:T) - O(1)
- pop(): T | undefined - O(1)
- enqueue - add value to the queue or push to the queue - O(1)
- deque - removing value from the queue - O(1)
- Deletrion/Insertion at beginning of list - enqueue(unshift) - deque(shift) - O(1)
- Deletrion/Insertion in the middle - O(N)
- Deletrion/Insertion at end of list - O(1)
