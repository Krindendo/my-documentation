The simplest way to think of recursion is a function that calls itself until the problem is solved. This usually involves what is referred to as a "base case." A base case is the point in which the problem is solved at.

```ts title="The simplest example"
function foo(n: number):number {
  // Base Case
  if(n === 1){
    return 1;
  }

  //We shall Recurse!
  return n + foo(n - 1);
}
```

Base Case is most important thing in recursion, if you dont know what is base case then recursion is extremly hard.

There's something that's very important to understand about recursion and really about function calling. There's three values you can kind of really help to visualize this.

- return address - Every signle time a function is called, it needs to know how it got here. Because when the function is done, it needs to literally go back and hand back out its value. So we needs to know where that value goes to.

- return value - I need a value that i could return.

- arguments - We have to pass things into the function

procedure for recursion function above:

| return address | return value | arguments |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| foo5 | 5 + 10 | 5 |
| foo4 | 4 + 6 | 4 |
| foo3 | 3 + 3 | 3 |
| foo2 | 2 + 1 | 2 |
| foo1 | 1 | 1 |

when we get value 1 then we finally stopped recursing. We've hit a base case and we no loger need to keep calling functions.
Now it goes back. 2 plus return value 1, then 3 plus returned value 3 ...
