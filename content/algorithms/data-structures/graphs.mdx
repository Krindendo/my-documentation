Graph is a series of nodes with some amount of connections. There is no rules. It's just, there's a lot of connections between nodes or some connections or no connections.

### Terminology

#### Graph Terms

cycle: When you start at Node(x), follow the links, and end back at Node(x) - A -> B -> C -> D -> A

acyclic: A graph that contains no cycles

connected: When every node has a path to another node. Every node can reach to every other node.

not fully connectd graph is when we have node E that had a one way direction from C to E. Then Every node can reach E but E can't reach other nodes.

directed: When there is a direction to the connections. - There are one-way connections or the connections are asymmetric.

undirected: !directed. This means that nodes don't have any direction associated with them. You can go both ways.

weighted: The edges have a weight associated with them. Think Google Maps -> In one direction from example A to B cost 10 pounds but direction B to A costs 20 pounds.

dag: Directed, acyclic graph - example below - Is when you can't quite make it to any other node, everything has a terminus. So B could go all the way to C but it can't go any furher.

#### Implementation Terms

node: a point or vertex on the graph

edge: the connection betxit two nodes

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-7">- Big(O)</h3>

BigO is commonly started in terms of V and E where V stands for vertices and E stands for edges.
So O(V * E) means that we will check every vertex and on every vertex we check every edge.

For every Verte, we would visit every single edge in the graph.
