#### Terms:

- load factor: The amount of data points vs the amount of storage (data.len / storage.capacity)

- key: a value that is hashable and is used to look up data. The hash has to be consistent.

- value: a value that is associated with a key

- collision: when 2 keys map to the same cell

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">- How it works</h3>

We have a key and it need to map to value. Key is mapping to a value has to be a consistent hash. So this means is when i give case of 0 it will always give me the same answer back out.

We need hashing function that takes key and it needs to produce out some sort of unique number.
