#### Terms:

- load factor: The amount of data points vs the amount of storage (data.len / storage.capacity)

- key: a value that is hashable and is used to look up data. The hash has to be consistent.

- value: a value that is associated with a key

- collision: when 2 keys map to the same cell

We have a key and it need to map to value. Key is mapping to a value has to be a consistent hash. So this means is when i give case of 0 it will always give me the same answer back out.

We need hashing function that takes key and it needs to produce out some sort of unique number. Then we can take that unique number and module it
(unique number % lenght of data storage) and if lenght is 10 for example, that means our key can uniquly map to one of the section in array structure.

There are posibility that with multiple data will give keys that need to store in same section in array structure. And what happend when it collide. We will need to go to the next slot and put new value in it. And if you do that you will need more and more slots and it will become less and less efficient.

We can fix it if we use ArrayList or LinkedList.

If we want to get data, we will call our function with key that we will get index. To achieve this, we will need to store key and data in our arrayList because you can save multiple data in our slot. So you call hashing function, hashing function will give you index. Then **index % length of data storage** and you will know where to find in array. Then you will check if hash key is equal to hash key that is stored in arrayList of object we want.

Because ideal load factor is 0.7 and if it exceed that load factor we can take current data storage and we can iterate through all of the keys that we can find and then we can rehash them and restore them into a larger storage arena to cut down load factor.

We cant implement maps in JavaScript.
