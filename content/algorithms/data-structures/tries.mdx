If its not a priority queue, its a trie. People keep calling them try trees / prefix tree / digital tree.

Tre easiest way to visualize a trie is to think of auto-complete.

It can do it in O(1) time given that the keys meet some sort of minimum length, not to be very long, like length of 50.

-13:16 .....

Example: English language tree 

That means our tree could have 1 of 26 posible symbols as its children

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">- How it works</h3>

....

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-7">- Big(O)</h3>

- Get value is **O(1)**

- Insert is **O(N)**

- Deleting is  **O(N)**
