**WebSockets** are used in real-time connections when the **frontend and backend are constantly exchanging data in both directions**, such as when a real-time system requires consistent communication back and forth.

If you utilize a serverless stack, setting up websockets will be difficult since serverless apps do not have a long enough lifespan to send responses and maintain the server connection alive. Serverless is short-lived; you generate it and then kill it. 

**Polling** can be used when we simply want a one-time response.

Example: polling

```ts
const FIVE_MINUTS = 5 * 60 * 1000;
const url = "https://example.com/api/v1/book";
const delay = (ms: number) => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res,ms));

setLoading(true);
const startDate = Date.now();

while(true){
    if(Date.now() - startDate > FIVE_MINUTS){
        alert("Time out");
        setLoading(false);
        return;
    }
    const delayPromise = delay(500);
    try{
        const res = await fetch(url);
        if(!res.ok){
            throw new Error("Not ok");
        }
        const data = await res.json();
        console.log("data", data);
    } catch(err) {
        console.error(err);
    } finally {
        setLoading(false);
        return;
    }
    await delayPromise;
}
```
