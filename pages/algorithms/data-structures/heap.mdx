title: Heap
description: Heap or Priority Queue
---

The simplest way to put it is a binary tree where every child and grand child is smaller (MaxHeap), or larger (MinHeap) than the current node. It is self-balancing.

- Whenever a node is added, we must adjust the tree

- Whenever a node is deleted, we must adjust the tree

Heaps maintain week ordering, meaning that they are ordered, but it is not perfectly ordered. It's not in order of anything specific, but there is a rule at every single point.

Example below is MinHeap.

Condition for **MinHeap** is that current item in the root is **smallest** number in tree, so if i need **smallest** item out of tree, it's really simple, it's on top of tree.

Condition for **MaxHeap** is that current item in the root is **largest** number in tree, so if i need **largest** item out of tree, it's really simple, it's on top of tree.

A binary tree or heap is usually full or complete tree, that means it's always adding from left to right, and it never has any empty spaces.

How to add new node?

The simplest way is to put new value in the final spot in tree. Then, we need to sort tree so it be heap condition ordered. 

### Example: We need to add new value - 3 and we will use example from above

Because we use min heap, 3 is smaller then 101 then we need rotate nodes 3 and 101. Then we will check if value 3 is smaller then his new parent, 71. Yes, then we will rotate again, and again until we have fulfills heap condition.

### Example: We need to remove value - 50 and we will use example from above

First we will get very last node in the tree. In our case from example it is 101. Then we will remove value that we want and on that position we will put 101.

After that we're gonna take the minimum of two children and compare against 101. Then we will rotate 101 with minumum value of two children and we will do that until we fulfills heap condition.

### How to find children/parent

Use this formula:

```ts
  private parent(idx: number): number {
    return Math.floor((idx - 1) / 2)
  }
  private leftChild(idx: number): number {
    return idx * 2 + 1
  }
  private rightChild(idx: number): number {
    return idx * 2 + 2
  }
```

- Insert is **O(N)**

- Deleting is  **O(N)**

```ts
export default class MinHeap{
  public length: number;
  private data: number[];

  constructor(){
    this.data = [];
    this.length = 0;
  }

  insert(value: number): void {
    this.data[this.lenghth] = value;
    this.heapifyUp(this.length);
    this.length++;
  }
  delete(): number | undefined{
    if(this.length === 0){
      return undefined;
    }

    const out = this.data[0];
    this.length--;

    if(this.length === 0){
      this.data = []
      return out;
    }

    this.data[0] = this.data[this.length];
    this.heapifyDown(0);
    return out;

  }

  private heapifyDown(idx: number): void {
    const lIdx = this.leftChild(idx);
    const rIdx = this.rightChild(idx);

    if(idx >= this.lenghth || lIdx >= this.lenght){
      return;
    }

    const lV = this.data[lIdx];
    const rV = this.data[rIdx];
    const v = this.data[Idx];

    if(lV > rV && v > rV){
      this.data[idx] = rV;
      this.data[rIdx] = v;
      this.heapifyDown(rIdx);
    }
    else if(rV > lV && v > lV){
      this.data[idx] = lV;
      this.data[lIdx] = v;
      this.heapifyDown(lIdx);
    }

  }

  private heapifyUp(idx: number): void {
    if(idx === 0){
      return;
    }
    const p = this.parent(idx);
    const parentV = this.data[p];
    const v = this.data[idx];

    if(parentV > v){
      this.data[idx] = parentV;
      this.data[p] = v;
      this.heapifyUp(p);
    }
  }

  private parent(idx: number): number {
    return Math.floor((idx - 1) / 2)
  }
  private leftChild(idx: number): number {
    return idx * 2 + 1
  }
  private rightChild(idx: number): number {
    return idx * 2 + 2
  }
}
