<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">- How it works</h3>

It will go in order checking if the current value is greater than the value to its right, if so then it will rotate them. This will do (N*(N-1))/2 times.

```js
[1,3,7,4,2] // initial array | N checks
[1,3,4,2,7] // 1. iteration | N-1 checks
[1,3,2,4,7] // 2. iteration | N-2 checks
[1,2,3,4,7] // 3. iteration | N-N+1 checks
```

After the first iteration, the highest number will be at the end of the array, so on the second iteration, we will not include the last position because it is already sorted.

Running time for this algorithm is (N*(N-1))/2. But how?

example - add the numbers from 1 to 100 as written in the example

1...100 = 101
2...99  = 101
3...98  = 101
.
.
50..51  = 101

101*50

(N+1)*N/2 => (N*(N+1))/2


<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-7">- Big(O)</h3>

It is **O(N^2)**.

Lets continue from example: add the numbers from 1 to 100 as written in the example

Because we dont need constants. Formula is N(N+1) => N^2 + N 

Now we will ignore non significant values so formula is N^2

The reason why we drop N from N^2 + N is just because it will not drastically change the result.

If we take input (N) to be 10 000. 10 000^2 + 10 000 = 100 010 000, so N in N^2 + N formula is insignificant so we remove it.

```ts
export default function bubble_sort(arr: number[]): void {
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i){
    for(let j = 0; j < arr.length - 1 - i; ++j){
      if(arr[j] > arr[j + 1]){
        const tmp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j+1] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
