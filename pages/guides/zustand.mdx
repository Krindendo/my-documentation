### Why Zustand?

- little boilerplate

- doesnt rely provider

- faster then context - it allows you to specificly select what state you want to subscribe to

- state merging by default

- extendable by default - you can add custom middleware to give more functionality

- little opinionated

### Diferent between context and zustand

If you have context with valueA and valueB and you want to access valueA in a component, you will be subscribed to all states in that context. This is a problem, because if you change
valueB, your component will also re-render.

With zustand store, we can have multiple values in the store, but another component will subscribe only to the value that wants to subscribe. which means that it will re-render only if valueA changes.

#### Are re-renders bad?

No, if you have complex react logic, witch shoud be in useMemo or useEffect. If value doesnt change that often or is not that complext then it not problem for react to handle.

Renders dont change the DOM - all computation are on shadow DOM and only if there are diference between shadow DOM and actually DOM, there will be commands to change the DOM. 
With is very expensive part
