## Redux

Redux terms: 

- Actions: An action is a plain JavaScript object that has a type field. **You can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application.**

- Reducers: A reducer is a function that receives the current state and an action object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state: (state, action) => newState. **You can think of a reducer as an event listener which handles events based on the received action (event) type.**

- Store: The current Redux application state lives in an object called the store.

- Dispatch: The Redux store has a method called dispatch. The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object.

- Selectors: Selectors are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from a store state value. As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data
