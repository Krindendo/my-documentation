Why Design Patterns are important?

- Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.

- Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently. You can say, “Oh, just use a Singleton for that,” and everyone will understand the idea behind your suggestion.

All patterns can be categorized by their purpose:

- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Creational patterns

- [Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)
- [Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)
- [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)
- [Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)
- [Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)

## Structural patterns

- [Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)
- [Bridge](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge)
- [Composite](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite)
- [Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)
- [Facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)
- [Flyweight](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight)
- [Proxy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy)
