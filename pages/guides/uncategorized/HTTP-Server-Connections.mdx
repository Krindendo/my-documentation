Before making an HTTP request for a resource browsers first need to create a connection to the web server that they want to load the resource from.

You can see a server connection being created when looking at a request waterfall, for example from our free speed test or in Chrome DevTools.

You can see **three other steps in teal, orange, and purple before the HTTP request** shown in green and the download in blue. These three steps are where the connection is created.

Typically three steps are required to establish a connection to an HTTP server:

- DNS lookup: finding the server IP address based on the domain name
- TCP connection: enabling reliable communication
- TLS/SSL connection: enabling secure encrypted communication

After that HTTP requests can be made to request resources from the server.

## DNS lookup

IP addresses like `12.34.456.789` are used to route messages between different computers on a network. However, they are difficult to remember and not nice to work with for humans. A website may also move from one server to the other, and we donâ€™t want to update all references to the website when that happens.

Instead we use domain names to address websites. The Domain Name System (DNS) allows us to map a domain like `example.com` to an IP address.

Before sending an HTTP request to a server we first need to perform a DNS lookup to find its IP address.

You can use `dig` on the command line to find the IP address of a server:
