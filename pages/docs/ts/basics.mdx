### Access modifiers

The main purpose of access modifiers is to control and restrict access to members of a class.

- Public (default) - This means it can be accessed from anywhere in your code, including outside the class itself.

- Private - are only accessible within the class itself. In Javascript, private properties are created with a hash '#' prefix, but in Typescript, they are created with the keyword private. Properties cannot be legally referenced outside of the class.

- Protected - are accessible within the class and its subclasses. In TypeScript, they are created with the keyword protected, whereas in JavaScript, protected members are indicated by a '_' prefix before the name.

```ts
class Calculation{
  protected x: number;
  protected y: number;
  
  private counter: number = 0;
  protected lastCalculation: number = 0;

  constructor(x:number, y:number){
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  public sum(){
    this.counter++;
    this.lastCalculation = this.x + this.y
    return this.lastCalculation;
  }

  protected counts(){
    return this.counter;
  }
}

class Multiple extends Calculation {
  constructor(x: number, y: number){
    super(x,y);
  }

  public multiple() {
    this.counter++;

    this.lastCalculation = this.x * this.y;

    return this.lastCalculation
  }
  
}

const calcSum = new Calculation(1,2);
const calcMult = new Multiple(1,2);

console.log("sum of 1 and 2 is", calcSum.sum());
console.log("multiple of 1 and 2 is", calcMult.sum());

// These are not available
calcSum.x;
calcSum.lastCalculation;

```

### Abstract class

- You cannot use an abstract class to directly create an object. if we think of a class as a blueprint for constructing a house for example, then an abstract class is a type of blueprint that we cannot use to directly build a house. Instead, an abstract class is a class that another class can inherit from.

```ts
abstract class Shape {
  name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
     this.name = name;
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  radius: number;
  constructor(name: string, radius:number){
     super(name);
     this.radius = radius;
  }
    
}

const myShape = new Shape('My shape'); // This will throw an Error 
const shortCircle = new Circle("Short Circle", 0.5); // This will work fine.
```

### Difference between class and interface

``Class:``

- **A blueprint for creating objects.** It defines the properties (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.

- You can instantiate a class using the new keyword, which creates a new object with the properties and methods defined in the class.

- Classes can have constructors to initialize properties during object creation.

- A class can inherit from another class, acquiring its properties and methods.

``Interface:``

- Defines the structure or shape of an object and specify the properties and methods that an object has or should have.

### Partial interface

for c# this is 

- A key reason to use partial classes is to organize code related to different functionalities of the same class across multiple files.

for Typescript:

- Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to optional.

### How to integrate typescript

1. install TypeScript

2. add a tsconfig.json - It differs for different project types.

3. change a files to .ts or .tsx

### Type guard

- A type guard is a mechanism that allows you to refine the type of a variable within a specific code block. It essentially performs a check to determine the exact type of the variable at runtime.

TypeScript uses built-in JavaScript operators like typeof, instanceof, and in to determine if an object contains a property.

- instanceof is a built-in type guard that can be used to check if a value is an instance of a given constructor function or class.

- TypeScript follows possible paths of execution that our programs can take to analyze the most specific possible type of a value at a given position. It looks at these special checks (called type guards) and assignments, and the process of refining types to more specific types than declared is called ``narrowing``.

```ts
  interface Accessory {
      brand: string;
    }
    class Necklace implements Accessory{
      kind: string;
      brand: string;
      constructor(brand: string, kind: string) {    
        this.brand = brand;
        this.kind = kind;
      }
    }
    class bracelet implements Accessory{
      brand: string;
      year: number;
      constructor(brand: string, year: number) {    
        this.brand = brand;
        this.year = year;
      }
    }
    const getRandomAccessory = () =>{
      return Math.random() < 0.5 ?
        new bracelet('cartier', 2021) :
        new Necklace('choker', 'TASAKI');
    }
    let Accessory = getRandomAccessory();
    if (Accessory instanceof bracelet) {
      console.log(Accessory.year);
    }
    if (Accessory instanceof Necklace) {
      console.log(Accessory.brand);    
    }
  ```

  - The typeof type guard is used to determine the type of a variable.

  ```ts
  typeof v === "boolean"
  ```

  - The `in` type guard checks if an object has a particular property

  ```ts
  "house" in { name: "test", house: { parts: "door" } }; // => true
  ```

  - The `is` operator checks if a value or variable is of a specific type. 

  ```ts
  interface Cat {
      meow(): void;
  }
  interface Dog {
      bark(): void;
  }
  function isCat(pet: Dog | Cat): pet is Cat {
      return (pet as Cat).meow !== undefined;
  }
  let pet: Dog | Cat;
  // Using the 'is' keyword
  if (isCat(pet)) {
      pet.meow();
  } else {
      pet.bark();
  }
  ```

### Dependency injection

is software design pattern used to reduce tight coupling between code components, making applications easier to test, maintain, and extend.

The key idea of DI is that a class should not create its own dependencies but instead receive them (inject them) externally, typically via a constructor, method, or property.

Key Concepts:

1. Dependency: Any class, object, or resource that another class requires to perform its function.

2. Injector: A component or mechanism responsible for creating and delivering dependencies to a class.

Benefits of DI:

- Loose Coupling: Components are not directly tied to their dependencies.

- Easier Testing: Dependencies can easily be replaced with mocks or stubs for testing.

- Reusability: Components are more flexible and can be reused in other parts of the code.

- Maintainability: Makes it easier to change dependencies without modifying the class itself.

Example: 

Without Dependency Injection:

```js
class EmailService {
  send(message, recipient) {
    console.log(`Sending email to ${recipient}: ${message}`);
  }
}

class NotificationService {
  constructor() {
    this.emailService = new EmailService(); // Hardcoded dependency
  }

  notify(message, recipient) {
    this.emailService.send(message, recipient);
  }
}

// Usage
const notificationService = new NotificationService();
notificationService.notify('Hello!', 'user@example.com');
```

With Dependency Injection:

```js
class EmailService {
  send(message, recipient) {
    console.log(`Sending email to ${recipient}: ${message}`);
  }
}

class SmsService {
  send(message, recipient) {
    console.log(`Sending SMS to ${recipient}: ${message}`);
  }
}

class NotificationService {
  constructor(notificationProvider) {
    this.notificationProvider = notificationProvider; // Dependency is injected
  }

  notify(message, recipient) {
    this.notificationProvider.send(message, recipient);
  }
}

// Usage
const emailService = new EmailService();
const smsService = new SmsService();

// Injecting EmailService
const emailNotificationService = new NotificationService(emailService);
emailNotificationService.notify('Hello via Email!', 'user@example.com');

// Injecting SmsService
const smsNotificationService = new NotificationService(smsService);
smsNotificationService.notify('Hello via SMS!', '+123456789');
```
