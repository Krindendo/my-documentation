## provide()

`provide()` takes two arguments: 
- key, which can be a string or a symbol
- value to be injected.

Similar to lifecycle hook registration APIs, provide() must be called synchronously during a component's setup() phase.

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, provide } from 'vue'
import { fooSymbol } from './injectionSymbols'

// provide static value
provide('foo', 'bar')

// provide reactive value
const count = ref(0)
provide('count', count)

// provide with Symbol keys
provide(fooSymbol, count)
</script>
```
