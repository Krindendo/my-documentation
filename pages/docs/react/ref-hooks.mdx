title: Ref Hooks
description: Refs let a component hold some information that isnt used for rendering and they are useful when you need to work with non-React systems.

- `useRef` You can hold any value in it, but most often its used to hold DOM node.
- `useImperativeHandle` lets you customize the ref exposed by your component.

## useRef

Used for saving DOM node and timeout ID.

### Caveats

- The ref.current property can mutate. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering, then you shouldn’t mutate that object.

- Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object.

- Do not write or read ref.current during rendering, except for initialization. This makes your component’s behavior unpredictable. (example: don'ts)

### Example: Don'ts

```tsx title="do's"
function Main() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // You can read or write refs in effects
    ref.current = "something"
  })

  function handleClick() {
    // You can read or write refs in event handlers
    doSomething(myOtherRef.current)
  }
}
```

```tsx title="don'ts"
function Main() {
  // Don't write a ref during rendering
  ref.current = "something"

  // Don't read a ref during rendering
  return <h1>{myOtherRef.current}</h1>
}
```

### Example: basic

```tsx
function Calculator() {
  const [sum, setSum] = useState(0)
  // ...
}
```

## useImperativeHandle

If you don’t want to expose the entire \<input> DOM node, but you want to expose two of its methods: focus and scrollIntoView. To do this, keep the real browser DOM in a separate ref. Then use useImperativeHandle to expose a handle with only the methods that you want the parent component to call

<Callout type="warning">

Do not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.

If you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like \{ open, close \} from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like `<Modal isOpen={isOpen} />`. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.

</Callout>

### Parameters

- The ref you received as the second argument from the forwardRef render function.

- A function that takes no arguments and returns the ref handle you want to expose.

- The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the function. If a re-render resulted in a change to some dependency, or if you omitted this argument, this function will re-execute, and the newly created handle will be assigned to the ref.

### Example: basic

```tsx title="MyInput.tsx" {8-13}
import { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle, useRef } from "react"

const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {
  const inputRef = useRef(null)

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
      return {
        focus() {
          inputRef.current.focus()
        },
        scrollIntoView() {
          inputRef.current.scrollIntoView()
        },
      }
  }, [])

  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />
})

export default MyInput
```

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { useRef } from "react"

import MyInput from "./MyInput.js"

export default function Form() {
  const ref = useRef(null)

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current.focus()
    // This won't work because the DOM node isn't exposed:
    // ref.current.style.opacity = 0.5;
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <MyInput placeholder="Enter your name" ref={ref} />
      <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
        Edit
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
